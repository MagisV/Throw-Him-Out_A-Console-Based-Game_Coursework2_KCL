/**
 * This class holds information about a command that was issued by the user.
 * A command consists of up to three parts: a CommandWord and up to two parameters.
 *
 * The way this is used is: Commands are already checked for being valid
 * command words through the enum class CommandWord. If the user entered an invalid command (a word that is not
 * known) then the CommandWord is UNKNOWN.
 *
 * The first word is always the command word. Every parameter not used in a command is set to null.
